# CainsJawboneTool
A rusty cli tool to help people (mainly me lol) solve the riddle "Cain's Jawbone" by Torquemada

Cain's Jawbone is a literary puzzle where the reader is given 100 pages that form a short novel. However, the pages are in random order.
The reader's task is to find the right page order, as well as find the killers and victims of the the six murders throughout the story.

When finished, this tool will basically be a user-friendlyish command line database for this riddle. The database will already include the full text, divided into pages, while the user will be able to display, edit and add data, such as notes, connections and more.

I tried to make the commands somewhat speech like, so that this will hopefully also be accessible for people who otherwise don't live in the terminal.
